# SeqDEX daemon module

The Go module holding everything server- and client-side for SeqDEX except the
wallet daemon: the SeqOB order-book relay and its maker/taker/settler programs,
the covenant builder, the RFQ trade daemon (forked from
[tdex-daemon](https://github.com/tdex-network/tdex-daemon)), and the
cross-chain HTLC engine. The wallet daemon it settles through lives in
[`../wallet`](../wallet). Design: [../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
(a 2026-07-08 snapshot; this file is current as of 2026-08-22);
runbooks: [../docs/DEV.md](../docs/DEV.md).

Everything here is testnet software; nothing in this module ever holds user
funds (the RFQ daemon holds only its operator's own market-making liquidity,
via the wallet daemon, and `seqob-bridge` only its own fronted inventory).

## Binaries

### `cmd/seqobd`: the order-book relay

Non-custodial: stores signed offers, serves the per-pair book, matches
crossing orders, couriers opaque end-to-end-encrypted swap-session frames. No
wallet, no keys, no funds, never decrypts.

```
seqobd [flags]
  -listen            HTTP listen address        (default ":9955", env SEQOB_LISTEN)
  -node-rpc          read-only Sequentia node RPC host:port for the covenant
                     chain-watcher; empty disables the watcher
                                                (env SEQOB_NODE_RPC)
  -node-rpc-user / -node-rpc-pass   node JSON-RPC credentials
                                                (env SEQOB_NODE_RPC_USER / _PASS)
  -watch-interval    chain-watcher reconcile interval (default 5s)
  -session-deadline  lift co-sign deadline      (default 2m)
  -xsession-deadline courier deadline for cross-chain lift sessions
                     (default 3h; they span a real parent-chain confirmation)
  -expiry-sweep      offer expiry sweep interval        (default 15s)
  -session-sweep     session deadline sweep interval    (default 10s)
  -min-expiry / -max-expiry   allowed offer expiry horizon (30s .. 168h)
  -offers-per-min / -offers-per-min-ip   rate limits (60 per maker key, 120 per IP)
  -trade-log         append-only JSONL trade log so last_price, trades and
                     candles survive a restart (env SEQOB_TRADE_LOG; empty =
                     in-memory only)
  -interactive-cap   soft per-maker committed-capital cap per offered asset
                     (atoms) for interactive offers; past it an offer is
                     flagged demoted (phantom depth); 0 disables
```

HTTP surface (bodies are protojson of `api-spec/protobuf/seqob/v1`):

```
POST /v1/offers                             submit a signed Offer
POST /v1/offers/cancel                      submit a signed OfferCancel
GET  /v1/offers?maker_pubkey=<hex>          a maker's own orders
GET  /v1/markets                            market summaries
GET  /v1/market/{base}/{quote}/orderbook    per-pair snapshot
POST /v1/lift                               open a lift session
GET  /v1/ws                                 WebSocket (To/From envelope): book
                                            subscriptions, offer submission,
                                            lift and match notifications,
                                            opaque SwapMsg courier
```

Live instances: `https://sequentiatestnet.com/seqob/v1/...` (on-chain rails),
`/seqob-pln/v1/...` (Lightning rails), `/seqob-conf/v1/...` (confidential
markets); one `seqobd` process per mount.

### `cmd/seqob-maker`: the maker participant

Posts one signed resting offer and serves lifts until stopped. Anyone can run
one; the relay grants makers no special standing. Six settlement modes:

- `-mode samechain` (default): asset-for-asset atomic swap, settled through the
  Ocean wallet's blind-aware `CompleteSwap`. Needs `-ocean` + `-account` (the
  account holding the offered asset) and `-node-rpc` for the open fee market.
  `-confidential=false` (default: Sequentia is transparent by default) settles
  explicit; `-confidential=true` publishes a blinding pubkey and settles blinded.
- `-mode cross`: BTC-for-asset on-chain HTLC swaps. Funds legs from node
  wallets directly: needs `-btc-rpc`/`-btc-wallet`/`-btc-chain`
  (testnet4|regtest) and `-xseq-rpc`/`-xseq-wallet`. Pair is always
  base = the asset (`-base`), quote = the `"BTC"` sentinel; `-base-amount` is
  asset atoms, `-quote-amount` BTC sats; no partial fills. Per-lift session
  state persists under `-xstate-dir`; `-resume` finishes every non-terminal
  session (claim or refund) after a restart, then exits. Safety dials:
  `-min-btc-conf` (default 1), `-btc-locktime-delta` (T_btc, default 100
  parent blocks), `-seq-locktime-delta` (T_seq, default 240 Sequentia blocks),
  `-btc-fee-rate`, `-spend-fee`.
- `-mode lightning`: submarine swaps (asset on-chain against BTC over
  Lightning). Needs `-ln-socket` (a SeqLN/CLN `lightning-rpc` on Bitcoin) plus
  `-xseq-rpc`/`-xseq-wallet`. `-side buy` serves the NORMAL direction (taker
  sells the asset, maker pays the taker's invoice), `-side sell` the REVERSE
  (maker locks the asset, taker pays the maker's invoice).
  `-sub-anchor-depth` (default 3, floor 2) is the Bitcoin-anchor depth the
  maker requires on the taker's Sequentia funding before taking the
  irreversible Lightning action.
- `-mode pureln`: both legs over Lightning, no on-chain leg and no anchor
  wait. Needs `-ln-socket` (BTC leg) and `-asset-ln-socket` (the maker's
  SeqLN-on-Sequentia socket, asset leg). `-quote-asset` advertises an
  asset-for-asset market instead of the BTC sentinel and `-btc-asset` routes
  the counter leg over that asset; `-hold-timeout` (default 2m) bounds the
  wait for the taker's hold invoice.
- `-mode subasset` / `-mode subasset-sell`: the submarine's mirror, the asset
  over Lightning against an on-chain BTC HTLC. `subasset`: the taker pays BTC
  on-chain and receives the asset over LN; `subasset-sell`: the reverse. Need
  `-asset-ln-socket` plus `-btc-rpc`/`-btc-wallet`/`-btc-chain`; with
  `-quote-asset` the on-chain leg becomes an HTLC on that Sequentia asset
  (via `-xseq-rpc`/`-xseq-wallet`) and no bitcoind is involved.

`-requote` (cross, lightning, pureln, sub-asset) re-posts a fresh offer under
the same id after each settled fill instead of exiting.

Common flags: `-relay`, `-maker-priv` (32-byte hex identity/E2E key, generated
if empty), `-base`, `-quote`, `-side sell|buy`, `-base-amount`,
`-quote-amount`, `-fee-asset` (hint, any-asset fee market),
`-min-anchor-depth` (Bitcoin-anchor confirmations before the order is FILLED;
default 0 = 0-conf tolerant), `-expiry`, `-offer-id`, `-msats-per-byte`.

### `cmd/seqob-cli`: the taker (and ad-hoc maker) CLI

```
seqob-cli post         post a signed offer (no maker process; lifts need one)
seqob-cli book         print a market's order book
seqob-cli lift         lift a same-chain offer (real settlement with
                       -esplora -taker-priv -taker-blinding; stub-wallet
                       demo mode without them)
seqob-cli xlift        buy an asset with on-chain BTC (forward cross-chain)
seqob-cli xsell        sell an asset for on-chain BTC (reverse cross-chain)
seqob-cli xrefund      recover the BTC leg of an aborted xlift after T_btc
seqob-cli xrefund-seq  recover the asset leg of an aborted xsell after T_seq
seqob-cli xsublift     sell an asset for BTC over Lightning (normal submarine)
seqob-cli xsubbuy      buy an asset with BTC over Lightning (reverse submarine;
                       anchor-gates the maker's HTLC before paying)
seqob-cli xpln         trade an asset against BTC with both legs over
                       Lightning (pure-LN; -side buy|sell, -asset-ln-socket,
                       -ln-socket)
seqob-cli xsubas       buy an asset by paying BTC on-chain and receiving it
                       over Lightning (sub-asset; -taker-ln-node-id for a
                       non-custodial hold-invoice buy)
seqob-cli xsubas-refund      recover the BTC HTLC of an aborted xsubas after T_btc
seqob-cli xsubas-sell        sell an asset over Lightning for on-chain BTC
seqob-cli xsubas-claim-btc   claim the BTC HTLC of an xsubas-sell with the preimage
seqob-cli xsubas-refund-btc  LSP side: reclaim a payer-bridge BTC HTLC after T_btc
seqob-cli xsubas-htlc-spend-status
                       read the on-chain fate of a BTC HTLC (unspent, claimed
                       with the preimage, or refunded); fails closed
seqob-cli xsubas-node-caps   assert the BTC node is unpruned with a synced
                       txindex before running payer bridges
seqob-cli xhtlc-observe      report an HTLC outpoint's spend on either chain
                       (extracting the preimage when given the hash)
seqob-cli xfund-seq    fund an on-chain Sequentia asset HTLC
seqob-cli xseq-refund  reclaim an asset HTLC by outpoint after T_seq
seqob-cli keygen       print a fresh 32-byte hex key and its pubkey
```

Run any subcommand without flags for its exact flag list. Cross-chain
subcommands persist their session (secret, keys, legs, locktimes) to
`-state-file` before funding anything, so refunds survive a crash.

### `cmd/seqob-settler`: the passive-CLOB settler

Always-online, keyless, fundless settler for two covenant-funded resting
orders whose makers are both offline: the relay matches them, the settler
assembles the single joint FILL transaction, funds its fee and broadcasts.
Both covenants' FILL leaves enforce every maker credit, so it can only build a
conforming transaction or none. `plan` (JSON cross on stdin) prints the
enforced recipe; `run` is the loop against a relay and a node.

### `cmd/seqob-watcher`: the covenant chain-watcher

Reconciles the relay's covenant book to the node's current tip: removes
orders whose funding UTXO is gone (including after a Bitcoin-driven reorg),
re-rests partial-fill remainders at their new outpoint, holds unconfirmed
spends pending, re-opens fills that never confirmed. In production the same
core runs inside `seqobd` (`-node-rpc`); this binary exposes it standalone:
`classify` (JSON state on stdin) and `run`.

### `cmd/seqob-bridge`: the cross-rail bridge

Settles a covenant order against a Lightning order under one preimage when the
matcher crosses them: fills the on-chain covenant and delivers/collects the
Lightning leg through the submarine/pure-LN orchestrator. Unlike every other
seqob component it holds its own inventory and an LN node; the only capital at
risk is its own fronted inventory, bounded by the per-offer 0-conf cap.
`plan` and `run` as for the settler.

### `cmd/seqob-covenant`: the covenant builder CLI

`derive` prints a resting order's leaves, merkle data, output key and
scriptPubKey; `fill` prints the permissionless FILL spend (credit/remainder
indices, witness, control block). Byte-identical to the Python builder in
`../test/regtest`, pinned by `pkg/covenant/leaf_test.go`.

### `cmd/seqob-relaycli`: relay scripting client

`post` signs an offer and POSTs it (the stateless maker path); `take` signs,
submits over WebSocket and waits for the matcher's match. Used by the regtest
matcher proof.

### `cmd/seqob-octl`: maker account helper

Read-mostly Ocean helper: `-action balance | address | create` against
`-ocean <addr> -account <name>`. No keys, no signing.

### `cmd/tdexd`: the RFQ trade daemon

The forked tdex-daemon. It serves same-chain trades only; cross-chain lives in
`pkg/xchain` behind the SeqOB maker, CLI, settler and bridge (the RFQ
`XchainService` was removed on 2026-07-29). Configuration is env-only with
prefix `SEQDEX_` (upstream used `TDEX_`); the main keys (see
`internal/config/config.go` for all):

| Env | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SEQDEX_WALLET_ADDR` | ocean wallet gRPC endpoint | - |
| `SEQDEX_TRADE_LISTENING_PORT` | Trade interface (gRPC + grpc-web + REST) | `9945` |
| `SEQDEX_OPERATOR_LISTENING_PORT` | Operator interface | `9000` |
| `SEQDEX_NODE_RPC` | Sequentia node RPC URL for `getfeeexchangerates` (any-asset network fees); unset = legacy native-asset fee path | - |
| `SEQDEX_NO_MACAROONS`, `SEQDEX_NO_OPERATOR_TLS` | disable auth/TLS (dev) | `false` |
| `SEQDEX_DATADIR`, `SEQDEX_DB_TYPE`, `SEQDEX_LOG_LEVEL` | state and logging | `~/.seqdex-daemon`, `badger`, `4` |

Interfaces served:

- **Trade** (`:9945`, TLS optional, permissive CORS): gRPC
  `seqdex.v1.TradeService` plus grpc-web and a grpc-gateway REST mapping:
  `POST /v1/markets`, `/v1/market/balance`, `/v1/market/price`,
  `/v1/trade/preview`, `/v1/trade/propose`, `/v1/trade/complete`. The Trade
  interface starts after the wallet is unlocked.
- **Operator** (`:9000`, macaroons unless disabled): wallet init/unlock, market
  lifecycle, deposits, withdrawals, fee config (protos under
  `api-spec/protobuf/tdex-daemon/v2`). Drive it with `cmd/tdex` or the
  `seqdex-initwallet` / `seqdex-unlock` / `seqdex-market` helpers.

The REST gateway is not publicly exposed on the testnet.

### Demos and regtest helpers

- `cmd/seqdex-xchain-swapdemo`: runs the raw HTLC mechanism end to end against
  the two-chain regtest, including the negative test (a Sequentia leg with an
  insufficient anchor height is rejected). Despite its name it exercises
  `pkg/xchain`, not the retired RFQ service.
- `cmd/seqdex-taker`, `cmd/seqdex-market`, `cmd/seqdex-initwallet`,
  `cmd/seqdex-unlock`: throwaway regtest helpers for the RFQ loop.

## Build and test

```sh
go build ./...                                   # everything
make build                                       # tdexd via scripts/build (CGO, stripped)
go test ./internal/seqob/... ./pkg/xchain/... ./pkg/covenant/...
                                                 # unit + (auto-skipping) integration
make lint                                        # golangci-lint
```

The `pkg/xchain` integration tests start their own two-chain regtest via
`pkg/xchain/testdata/start-regtest.sh` when `SEQUENTIA_REPO` points at a built
node clone (or use running nodes via the test-only env knobs
`SEQDEX_XCHAIN_PARENT_RPC` / `SEQDEX_XCHAIN_SEQ_RPC`); otherwise they skip.
The consensus-level covenant proofs live in `../test/regtest`. See
[../docs/DEV.md](../docs/DEV.md).

## Upstream

This module began as tdex-daemon (MIT); upstream docs live at
https://dev.tdex.network/. The `internal/seqob`, `pkg/covenant` and
`pkg/xchain` trees and the `seqob*`/`seqdex-*` commands are new here;
`../NOTICE` retains the upstream notices.

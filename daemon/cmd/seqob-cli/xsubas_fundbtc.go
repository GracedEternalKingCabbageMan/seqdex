// xsubas-fund-btc: the DEVICE side of a fully non-custodial sub-asset buy — build,
// sign, and broadcast the BTC on-chain HTLC from the USER's OWN Bitcoin, so the LSP
// never fronts the BTC. In the browser this is btc.js signing with the device key;
// this CLI reproduces it for headless/box proofs.
//
// It builds the Design-A HTLC (claim = the maker's stable claim pubkey with P;
// refund = a device refund key after T_btc) on hash H, funds it from -btc-wallet
// (the user's bitcoind wallet), broadcasts it, and prints the HTLC params the
// wallet passes to POST /swap PLUS the device refund PRIVATE key (kept device-side,
// used only to reclaim the HTLC at CLTV if the maker never pays).
//

//     -btc-locktime <T_btc> -btc-rpc <url> -btc-wallet <user wallet> -btc-chain testnet4
//     [-refund-priv <hex>]   (a device refund key is generated + printed if omitted)
//
// LSP payer-bridge (fund-safety) mode: pass -refund-pub <hex compressed pubkey> to
// embed the CALLER's OWN refund pubkey in the redeem script INSTEAD of minting an
// ephemeral one here. The LSP mints its refund keypair and PERSISTS the private key
// to durable storage BEFORE calling this CLI, so the funding broadcast can never run
// ahead of a persisted refund key — closing the crash window (mint-here → broadcast →
// crash-before-persist) that would otherwise strand a funded HTLC (fund-loss). No
// private key is minted or returned in this mode; the caller already holds it and
// refunds via xsubas-refund-btc using the returned on-chain facts.

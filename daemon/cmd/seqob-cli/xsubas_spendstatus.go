// xsubas-htlc-spend-status: the LSP payer leg-bridge's AUTHORITATIVE recoup-vs-refund
// ORACLE. Given the LSP-funded BTC HTLC outpoint (txid,vout) + its redeem script, it
// reports the ON-CHAIN fate of that output — UNSPENT, SPENT_VIA_CLAIM (returns the
// revealed preimage P), or SPENT_VIA_REFUND — by reading the chain, NOT a persisted
// intent flag.
//
// This is the structural fix for the round-6 race: the recoup/refund decision keyed on
// s.refunded (a persisted INTENT), which is racy across the persist/broadcast window
// (crash-before-broadcast => stale true; RPC-error-after-broadcast => stale false).
// The LSP's BTC HTLC has EXACTLY ONE spend: the CLAIM branch (spender reveals P => the
// maker got paid => the LSP MUST recoup the taker's hold) or the REFUND/CLTV branch
// (the LSP reclaimed its BTC => the maker is unpaid => the hold MUST be released to the
// taker, never captured). This command reads which one happened, idempotently.
//
// INVARIANT the LSP enforces off the result:
//   SPENT_VIA_CLAIM  => recoup the taker's hold (settle with the returned preimage).
//   SPENT_VIA_REFUND => release the taker's hold (never capture).
//   UNSPENT          => decide by P-public / T_btc as before (no spend yet).
//
// UNCERTAIN handling (fail closed): if ANY chain/wallet lookup errored or a spend was
// seen but could not be classified, this exits NON-ZERO and prints nothing actionable.
// The caller treats a non-zero exit as RETRYABLE and re-drives — it must NEVER treat
// uncertainty as a fate (a stale "unspent"/"refund" could release a hold the maker
// already claimed against, or a stale "claim" could capture a hold the maker never got).
//
// NODE REQUIREMENT: reading a confirmed NON-wallet maker CLAIM (the sole on-chain source of
// P when the maker wins the T_btc race) needs txindex + an UNPRUNED node. The LSP's OWN
// refund is a wallet tx and readable on any node; the maker's claim is not. A one-time
// startup check WARNs (or, with -require-node-caps, errors) when the node lacks either — a
// misconfigured node still fails closed (RETRYABLE) rather than mis-settling, but can never
// recoup a maker-claim front until fixed.

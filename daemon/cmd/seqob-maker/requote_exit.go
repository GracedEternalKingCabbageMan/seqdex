// Exit-for-requote: keep the book from silently losing this maker's offer.
//
// A resting offer has a hard expiry; the relay's sweep evicts it at that
// moment. Before this file, the maker noticed only on its next WS drop, then
// re-posted the ORIGINAL (already-expired) copy, which the validator rejected
// with "offer already expired" — so on a calm network the whole book emptied
// at expiry and stayed empty until someone manually restarted the fleet (288
// such rejections in the fleet logs on 2026-07-19).
//
// The uniform cure across every mode: shortly BEFORE expiry, the maker exits
// cleanly. Every maker runs under a supervisor (supervise-*.sh loop or a
// systemd unit) that immediately re-runs it, which re-reads the price oracle —
// so a re-quote is also a re-PRICE, and the book never rests a stale quote.
// The exit waits for any in-flight swap: sessions carry funds mid-HTLC, so we
// only retire when idle and otherwise exit the moment the session finishes.

// Package bridge is the SILENT cross-rail settlement bridge for the SeqOB CLOB.
//
// It lets an order placed ON-CHAIN (a funded covenant resting order) match an
// order placed on LIGHTNING, invisibly. The two owners each rest on the rail
// THEY chose and never learn a bridge was involved: no "LP", no "submarine", no
// "take" vs "post", no on-chain-vs-Lightning label. The relay's matcher crosses
// them by price-time priority exactly like any other cross and surfaces a
// CrossRail match (matcher.Match.CrossRail); the bridge turns that match into a
// single atomic settlement that moves value between the two rails.
//
// What the bridge is NOT. It is not a market maker and not a liquidity pool /
// AMM (that is a separate future feature any user can run). Its ONLY job is to
// bridge one on-chain order to one Lightning order so their cross settles. It is
// value-flat except for the fee/spread it keeps.
//
// The settlement (one shared SHA256 preimage P binds both legs):
//
//   - On-chain leg: the bridge FILLS the covenant. It pays the on-chain maker
//     that maker's own pinned ceil price in asset Y (covenant.Order.PlanFill,
//     consensus-enforced) and receives the sold asset X. The bridge cannot
//     underpay, redirect, or skim: the FILL leaf re-checks every maker-facing
//     output, so a cheating bridge builds a transaction the covenant rejects
//     (script-verify-flag-failed) — identical to the settler's guarantee.
//
//   - Lightning leg: the bridge delivers X to the Lightning counterparty and
//     collects Y from it over Lightning, via the submarine / pure-LN orchestrator
//     (pkg/xchain) — REUSED unchanged, never rebuilt.
//
// Net: asset X moves on-chain -> Lightning, asset Y moves Lightning -> on-chain;
// the bridge keeps FeeY = (Y collected over LN) - (Y paid to the on-chain maker).
//
// Trust / no-loss model. The bridge is a SEPARATE process from the keyless,
// fundless relay (seqobd) and from the fundless settler/watcher: unlike them it
// DOES hold its own inventory and an LN node (it must, to front). But it can
// never take USER funds — the on-chain maker is protected by consensus (the FILL
// leaf) and the Lightning counterparty is protected by the preimage atomicity.
// The ONLY capital ever at risk is the bridge's OWN fronted inventory, and only
// on a Bitcoin reorg of the on-chain FILL, bounded by the per-offer 0-conf cap
// (max_0conf_amount) and required to be covered by the fee (principle #4). Above
// the cap the bridge refuses to 0-conf-front and waits for the FILL to be
// anchor-buried before releasing the Lightning leg (RunNormal/RunReverse already
// implement exactly this gate). So no counterparty can be cheated and the bridge
// itself can lose at most what its own fee already covers.

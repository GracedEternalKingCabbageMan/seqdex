// Package matcher is the SeqOB relay's continuous limit-order-book matching
// engine: per-pair, price-time-priority crossing on top of the offerstore.
//
// On every accepted offer_submit the relay runs Cross(incoming): it walks the
// resting OPPOSITE side of the incoming order's pair, best-price-first then
// oldest-first, and while the incoming crosses the top resting order (integer-
// ratio compare, the same price floor ValidateRequestAgainstOffer enforces) it
// computes a fill size (honoring allow_partial / min_fill, and — for a covenant
// order — the covenant's own min_lot floor on both the fill and the remainder),
// and emits a Match. Any incoming remainder rests.
//
// The matcher is PURE plan + emit: it commits NO trade-truth. It never decrements
// an order and never records a trade — a cross is only a trade once it SETTLES
// on-chain, and only that is recorded, reorg-safely, by the owner of settlement:
// a covenant fill by the chain watcher on confirmation (a delta off the order's
// live size), an interactive lift by the maker's SettleAck. Recording/decrementing
// at match time surfaced phantom trades (an interactive auto-cross never settles)
// and, once the watcher was enabled, double-counted covenant fills. So the matcher
// is I/O-free and returns []Match for the caller (the api layer, which owns the
// websocket connections) to route as From.matched, and nothing more. For a COVENANT
// resting order the maker is offline; the Match carries the covenant terms + this
// fill's recipe so the counterparty (taker) settles the permissionless FILL spend
// itself, with nobody online but the taker.

"""SeqOB covenant FILL/REFUND leaves: passive, unilaterally-fillable resting orders.

A maker locks N units of explicit asset A in ONE taproot UTXO ("the order is the
coin"). The taproot output has internal key = NUMS (no key-path spend) and a two
leaf tree {FILL, REFUND}:

  FILL   (permissionless, NO maker signature) -- anyone may spend the order iff
         the spending transaction pays the maker the agreed price of asset B.
         Every order parameter (asset A id, asset B id, rate_num/rate_den, the
         maker payout scriptPubKey, min_lot) is a compile-time constant baked
         into the leaf, so it is committed inside the taproot output key: a taker
         can only satisfy the terms, never alter them. The leaf reads the price
         it must be paid entirely from transaction introspection; it needs NO
         witness data at all (witness = [FILL_script, control_block]).

  REFUND <expiry> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP <P_maker> OP_CHECKSIG -- after
         the absolute-locktime expiry the maker reclaims the order.

Design points enforced by the FILL leaf (see
docs/simplicity-dex-covenant-offers-design.md, sections 1-2, and
the node repo's doc/sequentia/openamp-design.md section 6):

  * Explicit-only. Every introspected asset/value prefix must be 0x01. A blinded
    (confidential) credit output the covenant cannot read is rejected.
  * Input-bound output map (anti-aliasing). The covenant input at consensus index
    k credits the maker at output 2k and re-pays its remainder at output 2k+1.
    Because the index is derived per input from OP_PUSHCURRENTINPUTINDEX, two
    covenant inputs can never both reference one shared maker-credit output, so a
    single payment can never settle two orders.
  * filled = locked - remainder, where `locked` is this input's own value
    (OP_INSPECTINPUTVALUE) and `remainder` is asset A re-paid to output 2k+1.
    For a FULL fill the taker supplies no asset-A output at 2k+1 (remainder 0).
  * Self-replication for partial fills is the last_will pattern: the remainder
    output's scriptPubKey must EQUAL this input's own scriptPubKey (compared via
    OP_INSPECTINPUTSCRIPTPUBKEY vs OP_INSPECTOUTPUTSCRIPTPUBKEY). Because the same
    order re-uses the identical covenant, direct scriptPubKey equality is
    sufficient and needs no OP_TWEAKVERIFY / tagged-hash self-proof (that
    machinery is only needed when the OUTPUT covenant differs from the INPUT
    covenant, e.g. per-holder keys in a self-referential covenant).
  * The maker must be paid at least ceil(filled * rate_num / rate_den) of asset B
    (ceil rounds in the maker's favour), computed with OP_MUL64/OP_ADD64/OP_DIV64
    as floor((filled*num + den - 1) / den).
  * Dust-griefing floors: filled >= min_lot, and any remainder >= min_lot.

Overflow bound (documented, asserted by the caller): OP_MUL64/OP_ADD64 abort on
signed-64-bit overflow, so orders must satisfy rate_num * N + rate_den - 1 < 2**63
(N = locked atoms). A wrong bound only self-harms the maker; pick sizes/rates
below it (u256 jets would lift it, unnecessary here).

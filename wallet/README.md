# SeqDEX wallet daemon (Ocean fork)

A thin fork of the [Ocean](https://github.com/vulpemventures/ocean) wallet
daemon, adapted to Sequentia. It is the wallet the SeqDEX daemons settle
through: `tdexd` talks to it over the unchanged `ocean.v1` gRPC contract
(`api-spec/protobuf/ocean/v1`), and the SeqOB maker reuses its swap-completion
service. It is an operator/market-maker wallet, not an end-user wallet
(end-user wallets are built on
[SWK](https://github.com/GracedEternalKingCabbageMan/SWK)).

Testnet software. The daemon manages its operator's own funds; it never holds
a counterparty's.

## What it does

- HD wallet (BIP39 mnemonic, SLIP-77 blinding) with named accounts, address
  derivation, coin selection, UTXO tracking.
- Builds, blinds, signs, and broadcasts PSETv2 transactions, including the
  cooperative atomic-swap completion (`CompleteSwap`) both DEX subsystems use.
  Blinding is per-call: Sequentia is transparent by default and confidential
  transactions are opt-in.
- Serves the `ocean.v1` gRPC interface on `:18000` (wallet, account,
  transaction, notification services). Client CLI: `cmd/ocean`.

## Sequentia changes relative to upstream Ocean

The fork is deliberately thin; the blinding/PSET/coin-selection core is generic
Elements code, untouched. What changed:

- **`pkg/seqnet`**: the Sequentia `network.Network` values. Addresses are
  deliberately Bitcoin-identical (bech32 `bc`/`tb`/`bcrt`, Bitcoin base58
  bytes); only the confidential (blech32) HRP is Sequentia-specific: `sqb`
  mainnet, `tsqb` testnet. Network names: `sequentia`, `sequentia-testnet`
  (default), `sequentia-regtest`.
- **Runtime policy asset**: Sequentia's native asset id is genesis-derived, so
  it is not a compile-time constant. `OCEAN_NATIVE_ASSET` is required and read
  from the node (`getsidechaininfo.pegged_asset`).
- **The `elements` blockchain scanner** reads block and header structure via
  JSON-RPC verbosity instead of raw-header deserialization, because
  go-elements cannot parse Sequentia's anchored PoS headers. Individual
  transactions still decode with go-elements (Sequentia is wire-compatible for
  transactions). The scanner polls the node tip (~2s) and needs
  `-blockfilterindex=1` on the node. A vendored neutrino-elements scanner
  variant exists as well (`internal/infrastructure/blockchain-scanner/`).
- **Open fee market**: non-swap transfers pay the network fee in the
  transacted asset (node-fed exchange rates) rather than assuming a native fee
  asset; swap-side any-asset fees live in the daemon module's `CompleteSwap`.
- Robustness fixes: non-200 / JSON-RPC-error node responses return errors
  instead of panicking; `importaddress` with `rescan=false` in `GetUtxos`.

## Configuration

Env-only, prefix `OCEAN_` (full list in `internal/config/config.go`):

| Env | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `OCEAN_NETWORK` | `sequentia` / `sequentia-testnet` / `sequentia-regtest` | `sequentia-testnet` |
| `OCEAN_NATIVE_ASSET` | policy asset hex (**required**; from `getsidechaininfo.pegged_asset`) | - |
| `OCEAN_NODE_RPC_ADDR` | node JSON-RPC as a full URL `http://user:pass@host:port` | - |
| `OCEAN_BLOCKCHAIN_SCANNER_TYPE` | `elements` (node-RPC scanner) | `elements` |
| `OCEAN_ESPLORA_URL` | optional Esplora endpoint (unset = node-RPC-only) | - |
| `OCEAN_PORT` | gRPC listen port | `18000` |
| `OCEAN_DATADIR`, `OCEAN_DB_TYPE` | state directory, `badger`/`inmemory`/`postgres` | `~/.seqdex-wallet`, `badger` |
| `OCEAN_NO_TLS` | disable TLS (dev) | `false` |

## Build and run

```sh
go build -o ../bin/seqdex-wallet ./cmd/oceand
go build -o ../bin/ocean         ./cmd/ocean     # CLI
```

Run against a local Sequentia regtest (how to start one, and why it must be an
Elements-mode chain: [../docs/DEV.md](../docs/DEV.md)):

```sh
OCEAN_NETWORK=sequentia-regtest \
OCEAN_NATIVE_ASSET=<pegged_asset hex> \
OCEAN_NODE_RPC_ADDR=http://s:s@127.0.0.1:19996 \
OCEAN_BLOCKCHAIN_SCANNER_TYPE=elements \
OCEAN_DB_TYPE=badger OCEAN_NO_TLS=true \
OCEAN_DATADIR=./oceand-data \
./bin/seqdex-wallet
```

Then, with the CLI: `ocean config init --no-tls`, `ocean wallet create` /
`unlock`, `ocean account create`, `ocean account derive`, `ocean account
balance`. The verified smoke flow is: create, unlock, create an account, derive
an address, fund it from the node, watch the balance sync.

## Tests

```sh
go test ./pkg/...        # passes (wallet math, derivation, single-sig)
```

The upstream suites under `internal/core/application` and
`internal/core/domain` predate the Sequentia network adaptation and currently
fail with "unknown network"; treat them as upstream-inherited, not as coverage
of the Sequentia paths. End-to-end coverage of this wallet comes from the
daemon module's swap flows and the regtest loops in
[../docs/DEV.md](../docs/DEV.md).

## Upstream

Upstream Ocean docs: https://github.com/vulpemventures/ocean. The `ocean.v1`
protos here are kept byte-identical to upstream so the daemon-wallet seam
stays drop-in; MIT notices are retained in [../NOTICE](../NOTICE).
